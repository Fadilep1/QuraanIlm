# Changes and Modifications
**Newers are on top**

## 4) 11th August, 2023
- added `keep_alive` file to prevent bot from going to sleep in cloud providers
- Started Organizing things


## 3) 4th July, 2023
- `/random` or `/rand` command added. As guessed, it'll give you a random verse from the Quran.
- Example: `/rand` or `/random` [Both are the same]
- Fixed a bug that was rejecting to search for surah if the text contained space. 


## 2) 2nd July, 2023
- `/surah` command added. So, you can get any verse by doing `/surah <surah name>:<verse number>`
- Example: `/surah 1:2`

- Changed Folder Structure. Added `ChangeLogs` and `TODO` files. Now the project is more organized.


## 1) 1st July, 2023
- User can just send any surah name and the bot will send at most 3 options to choose from.
- The options will be the most relevant surahs that matches the user's given name.
- Example: `Fatiha` will give `1 Al-Fatihah`, `20 Taha` and `48 Al-Fath` as options. But `Fatihah` will only give `1 Al-Fatihah` as option. The capitalization from the user doesn't matter.


## Previous Logs have not been kept. Sorry for the inconvenience.
